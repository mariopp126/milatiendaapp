## Prerequisites

- To run the project you need to have docker previously installed. You can download and install Docker from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).

## Instalation

Below are the steps required to install and configure the project in your development environment:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-user/your-project.git
    ```

2. Access the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd your-project
    ```

3. Optionally, create and activate a virtual environment for the project:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4. Install the project dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

Once these steps are completed, the project will be available at `http://localhost:8000/`. You can access this URL from your web browser to start using the application.
